      <h2>Dec 18: Coen Goes on Vacation</h2>
      <p>Today Coen took me to his house where his cat lives. He gave me $100 bucks to watch her while he goes on vacation. His cat seems chill.</p>

      <h2>Dec 20: Coenâ€™s Cat Wants a Bite </h2>
      <p>I came to Coen's house this morning with a breakfast burrito. Coen's cat gave me a friendly greeting, but got mad when I didn't share my burrito.</p>

      <h2>Dec 21: Sleepover with Coen's cat </h2>
      <p>Me and Coen's cat watched some Youtube and threw back a couple of brews last night. I had to leave this morning, so I tried to sneak out while she was sleeping but she woke up tried offering her belly up for a rub (not falling for it). </p>

      <h2>Dec 22: Thermostat </h2>
      <p>The weather may drop below freezing, so when I went over to Coen's house I set the thermostat to 68 so the pipes don't explode. </p>

      <h2>Dec 24: Christmas Eve </h2>
      <p>I came over to Coen's house today to hang out with his cat. I try to get some work done on my computer but Coen's cat doesn't seem to respect that. Also, I didn't notice that I'd set the thermostat only temporarily to 68, but luckily the temperature never dropped below freezing for very long in the last two days ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜“. </p>
